# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

In this analysis, we used a number of machine learning techniques to try to create a model for predicting credit-worthiness. We compared the accuracy of the different techniques to see which was the most effective. 

## Results

The results of this analysis can be viewed in the .ipynb files contained in this repository. The results of each method are listed below:
